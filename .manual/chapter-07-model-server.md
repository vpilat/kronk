The Kronk Model Server provides an OpenAI-compatible REST API for inference.
This chapter covers server configuration, management, and the catalog system.

**CLI Modes: Web vs Local**

Most CLI commands communicate with a running server by default:

```shell
kronk catalog list                  # Talks to server at localhost:11435
kronk model pull Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0    # Downloads via server
```

Add `--local` to run commands directly without a server:

```shell
kronk catalog list --local          # Direct file access
kronk model pull Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0 --local
kronk libs --local
```

Use `--local` when:

- The server isn't running yet
- You're setting up on the same machine where the server will run
- You prefer direct file operations

Use web mode (no flag) when:

- The server is running
- You want progress streaming in the BUI
- You're managing a remote server via `KRONK_WEB_API_HOST`

**Environment Variables**

Every command-line flag has a corresponding environment variable. The naming
convention is `KRONK_` followed by the flag name in uppercase with hyphens
replaced by underscores:

```
--api-host        →  KRONK_WEB_API_HOST
--budget-percent  →  KRONK_POOL_BUDGET_PERCENT
--models-in-pool →  KRONK_POOL_MODELS_IN_POOL
--pool-ttl       →  KRONK_POOL_TTL
--processor       →  KRONK_PROCESSOR
--hf-token        →  KRONK_HF_TOKEN
```

Environment variables are useful for:

- Configuration in Docker/Kubernetes deployments
- Setting defaults without repeating flags
- Keeping secrets out of command history

### 7.1 Starting the Server

**Install the CLI** (if not already installed)

```shell
go install github.com/ardanlabs/kronk/cmd/kronk@latest
```

**Basic Start**

```shell
kronk server start
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:11435` by default.

**Background Mode**

Run the server as a background process:

```shell
kronk server start -d
```

**Custom Host/Port**

```shell
kronk server start --api-host=0.0.0.0:9000
```

### 7.2 Stopping the Server

```shell
kronk server stop
```

### 7.3 Server Configuration

Configuration can be set via command-line flags or environment variables. Every
flag has a corresponding environment variable using the `KRONK_` prefix with
underscores replacing hyphens.

**Pool & Model Configuration Settings**

| Flag                  | Environment Variable           | Default                       | Description                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--model-config-file` | `KRONK_POOL_MODEL_CONFIG_FILE` | `<base>/model_config.yaml`    | Path to per-model configuration overrides. Defaults to the file under your `--base-path`.           |
| `--budget-percent`    | `KRONK_POOL_BUDGET_PERCENT`    | `80`                          | Percentage (1..100) of detected GPU VRAM and system RAM the resource manager may commit to loaded models. See [Section 7.5](#75-resource-manager). |
| `--models-in-pool`   | `KRONK_POOL_MODELS_IN_POOL`   | `10`                          | Safety-net cap on the number of distinct models kept loaded, regardless of budget. The default is set higher than typical concurrent use (1-3 models) so the budget remains the primary admission knob; lower it on small systems where you want a tighter hard ceiling on resident models. |
| `--pool-ttl`         | `KRONK_POOL_TTL`               | `20m`                         | How long an unused model stays loaded                                                               |

**Runtime Settings**

| Flag                 | Environment Variable     | Default    | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--base-path`        | `KRONK_BASE_PATH`        | `~/.kronk` | Base directory for all Kronk data                         |
| `--lib-path`         | `KRONK_LIB_PATH`         | _(empty)_  | Override path Kronk loads llama.cpp libraries from. Empty resolves the default per-triple folder under the libraries root (`<base>/libraries/<os>/<arch>/<processor>/`). A directory containing a `version.json` is used as-is. A non-empty directory without a `version.json` is treated as a read-only user-managed build. See chapter 2.3 for full semantics. |
| `--lib-version`      | `KRONK_LIB_VERSION`      | _(empty)_  | Specific llama library version                            |
| `--arch`             | `KRONK_ARCH`             | _(auto)_   | Architecture override (`amd64`, `arm64`)                  |
| `--os`               | `KRONK_OS`               | _(auto)_   | OS override (`linux`, `darwin`, `windows`)                |
| `--processor`        | `KRONK_PROCESSOR`        | _(auto)_   | Processor type (`cpu`, `metal`, `cuda`, `rocm`, `vulkan`) |
| `--hf-token`         | `KRONK_HF_TOKEN`         | _(empty)_  | Hugging Face API token for gated models                   |
| `--allow-upgrade`    | `KRONK_ALLOW_UPGRADE`    | `true`     | Allow automatic library upgrades to the latest llama.cpp release. The server defaults to `true` so a long-running server tracks upstream fixes. The standalone `kronk libs` CLI defaults to `false` (installs the well-known default version) and opts in via `--upgrade`. |
| `--llama-log`        | `KRONK_LLAMA_LOG`        | `1`        | Llama log level (0=off, 1=on)                             |
| `--insecure-logging` | `KRONK_INSECURE_LOGGING` | `false`    | Log sensitive data (messages, model config)               |

**Example**

```shell
kronk server start \
  --api-host=0.0.0.0:11435 \
  --budget-percent=80 \
  --pool-ttl=30m \
  --model-config-file=./model_config.yaml \
  --hf-token=hf_xxxxx
```

### 7.4 Model Caching

The server maintains a pool of loaded models to avoid reload latency.

**Configuration**

```shell
kronk server start \
  --budget-percent=80 \
  --models-in-pool=10 \
  --pool-ttl=20m
```

- `budget-percent` - Percentage (1..100) of detected GPU VRAM and system RAM
  the resource manager may commit to loaded models (default: 80)
- `models-in-pool` - Safety-net cap on the number of distinct models kept
  loaded, regardless of budget (default: 10). The default is set higher than
  typical concurrent use (1-3 models) so the budget remains the primary
  admission knob; lower it on small systems where you want a tighter hard
  ceiling on resident models.
- `pool-ttl` - How long an unused model stays loaded (default: 20m)

When a new model is requested and admitting it would exceed the budget,
the resource manager evicts the coldest idle model in the pool to free
room. If no idle model can be evicted (every loaded model has active
streams), the request returns `server busy`. See
[Section 7.5](#75-resource-manager) for the full admission and eviction
model.

### 7.5 Resource Manager

Kronk's pool sits behind an in-memory **resource manager** (resman) that
admits or rejects model loads based on a memory budget rather than a fixed
model count. The manager is a pure accountant — it never queries the GPU
or the OS at runtime; it works from a snapshot of detected devices taken
once at server startup and from per-model VRAM predictions.

**BudgetPercent**

`--budget-percent` (default `80`) is the single admission knob. It is
applied independently to:

- Each detected GPU's `TotalBytes` to derive that device's budget.
- The system's total RAM to derive the host RAM budget.

For example on a machine with one 24 GB GPU and 64 GB of RAM, the default
80% budget yields ~19.2 GB of GPU budget (minus a small per-GPU headroom
of 256 MiB) and ~51 GB of host RAM budget. A model is admitted only if
its predicted footprint fits within the budget that remains on the
appropriate device.

**Per-GPU buckets — VRAM is NOT pooled across cards**

Each GPU is its own independent budget bucket. The manager will never
"sum" two cards' free VRAM together to admit a single model. A model
that doesn't fit on any one card cannot be loaded today, even if the
combined free VRAM across cards would be large enough.

> Multi-GPU layer offload (loading parts of one model across multiple
> cards) is not supported yet. When a configuration explicitly lists
> multiple devices and supplies a `tensor-split`, the manager honors the
> split proportions and charges each card the corresponding share, but
> on each card the share must still fit within that card's per-GPU
> budget.

**File-size fallback for BERT-style models**

The VRAM prediction uses standard transformer metadata
(`block_count`, `attention.head_count_kv`, key/value lengths) to size
the KV cache and compute buffers. Some embedding/reranking models —
notably BERT-derived rerankers — don't expose those keys in their GGUF
metadata. For those models the manager falls back to charging the raw
on-disk file size against the budget. This is a conservative
under-estimate but is enough to gate concurrent loads.

**Eviction on a busy pool**

When a load is admitted but no headroom remains, the pool evicts the
coldest idle (no active streams) model in the cache, waits for its
unload to release the reservation, and retries. If every loaded model
has active streams, the request fails with `server busy: all model
slots have active requests` and the client should retry later.

**ModelsInCache safety-net cap**

`--models-in-pool` (default `10`) is a hard upper bound on the number
of distinct entries the pool will keep, independent of the byte budget.
The default is set higher than typical concurrent use (1-3 models) so
the budget remains the primary admission knob in normal operation. It
exists so operators on small systems — or anyone debugging cache churn
— can pin the maximum number of resident models with a single integer.

**Inspecting current usage**

The pool emits structured `resman-init` and `resman-usage` log lines on
startup and after every reserve/release, including per-GPU
`used/budget/free` and `ram-used/ram-budget`. These are the easiest way
to confirm the manager is reasoning about the right hardware.

### 7.6 Model Config Files

The server reads per-model overrides from `~/.kronk/model_config.yaml` by
default. Kronk seeds this file from an embedded default on first server
start; your edits are preserved across upgrades.

The file is a flat map keyed by canonical model id (`provider/modelID`,
optionally with a `/variant` suffix). Each entry's keys map 1:1 to
`model.Config` and use kebab-case:

```yaml
# ~/.kronk/model_config.yaml

unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0:
  context-window: 32768
  nseq-max: 4
  cache-type-k: q8_0
  cache-type-v: q8_0
  incremental-cache: true

unsloth/Ministral-3-14B-Instruct-2512-Q4_0:
  context-window: 8192
  ngpu-layers: 0
  split-mode: row

ggml-org/embeddinggemma-300m-qat-Q8_0:
  nseq-max: 2
```

To point at an alternative file (for testing without modifying your main
one):

```shell
kronk server start --model-config-file=./my-test-config.yaml
```

Or via environment variable:

```shell
export KRONK_POOL_MODEL_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/model_config.yaml
kronk server start
```

**Project Reference Configuration**

The Kronk repository includes a comprehensive reference configuration with
recommended settings for various models and use cases at
`zarf/kms/model_config.yaml`. It includes:

- Optimized configurations for coding agents (Cline, OpenCode)
- YaRN extended context examples
- IMC configuration for message caching
- Vision and audio model settings
- Detailed comments explaining each configuration option
- Examples of YAML anchors for sharing common settings between variants

### 7.7 Catalog System

The catalog (`~/.kronk/catalog.yaml`) is your **personal** catalog of
models. On first run Kronk seeds it from an embedded starter list so you
have something to choose from immediately; the catalog grows as you pull
models or resolve new IDs against HuggingFace.

Each entry is a resolution cache — provider, family (HF repo), revision,
file list, sizes, optional MMProj projection, and detected capabilities.
Templates come from the GGUF metadata of the downloaded model itself and
are not stored here.

**List entries in the catalog**

```shell
kronk catalog list
```

Output (real columns):

```
VAL   MODEL ID                                       PROVIDER   FAMILY                              ARCH      MTMD   SIZE
✓     ggml-org/embeddinggemma-300m-qat-Q8_0          ggml-org   embeddinggemma-300m-qat-q8_0-GGUF   bert      -      329.0 MB
✓     unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0                        unsloth    Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF                     qwen3     -      699.0 MB
✗     unsloth/Ministral-3-14B-Instruct-2512-Q4_0     unsloth    Ministral-3-14B-Instruct-2512-GGUF  llama     -      8.0 GB
```

`VAL` indicates whether the model files have been downloaded and
validated locally; `MTMD` indicates a multimodal projection (mmproj) is
present.

**Show catalog entry details**

```shell
kronk catalog show unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0
```

**Pull (download) a model**

```shell
kronk model pull unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0
```

After the pull completes, the catalog entry is enriched with the resolved
provider, family, revision, and file sizes so subsequent lookups don't
need to hit HuggingFace.

**Remove a catalog entry**

```shell
kronk catalog remove unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0   # also removes downloaded files
```

The same operations are available in the BUI's Catalog and Model views.

### 7.8 Runtime Settings

**Processor Selection**

```shell
kronk server start --processor=cuda    # NVIDIA GPU
kronk server start --processor=metal   # Apple Silicon
kronk server start --processor=vulkan  # Cross-platform GPU
kronk server start --processor=rocm    # AMD GPU (ROCm/HIP)
kronk server start --processor=cpu     # CPU only
```

**Library Path and Version Pinning**

You can point to a custom library directory and pin a specific llama.cpp version for stability:

```shell
kronk server start \
  --lib-path=/custom/path/to/libraries \
  --lib-version=b8864
```

Or via environment variable:

```shell
KRONK_LIB_VERSION=b8864 kronk server start
```

Breaking changes in llama.cpp can cause incompatibilities with yzma and Kronk. Use `--lib-version` (or `KRONK_LIB_VERSION`) to lock the server to a known-good version:

| llama.cpp | yzma    | kronk  |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| b8864     | v1.12.0 | 1.23.1 |
| b8865+    | v1.13.0 | 1.23.2 |

If you set `--allow-upgrade=false`, automatic library upgrades are disabled and the server will only use the version you have installed.

**Hugging Face Token**

For gated models requiring authentication:

```shell
kronk server start --hf-token=hf_xxxxx
```

Or via environment variable:

```shell
export KRONK_HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxx
kronk server start
```

### 7.9 Logging

**llama.cpp Logging**

```shell
kronk server start --llama-log=1    # Enable llama.cpp logs
kronk server start --llama-log=0    # Disable (default)
```

**Insecure Logging**

Enable logging of message content (for debugging only):

```shell
kronk server start --insecure-logging=true
```

**Warning:** This logs sensitive data. Never use in production.

**View Server Logs**

```shell
kronk server logs
```

### 7.10 Data Paths

Default data locations:

```
~/.kronk/
├── catalog.yaml                        # Personal catalog (resolution cache + provider list)
├── model_config.yaml                   # Per-model configuration overrides
├── libraries/                          # llama.cpp libraries (one folder per triple)
│   └── <os>/<arch>/<processor>/        # e.g. darwin/arm64/metal/, linux/amd64/cuda/
│       ├── libllama.so / .dylib / .dll
│       └── version.json
└── models/                             # Downloaded model files
    ├── .index.yaml                     # Local file index (validated state per model)
    └── <provider>/<family>/<file>.gguf
```

Each `(arch, os, processor)` library install lives in its own folder.
The runtime loads the folder for the detected triple by default; set
`KRONK_LIB_PATH` to a different triple folder (and restart) to switch
active install. See chapter 2.3 for `KRONK_LIB_PATH` semantics and the
install-management commands.

**Custom Base Path**

```shell
kronk server start --base-path=/data/kronk
```

`--base-path` shifts every file above to live under the new root.

### 7.11 Complete Example

Production-ready server configuration:

```shell
kronk server start \
  --api-host=0.0.0.0:11435 \
  --budget-percent=80 \
  --pool-ttl=20m \
  --model-config-file=/etc/kronk/model_config.yaml \
  --processor=cuda \
  --auth-enabled=true \
  -d
```

With model config:

```yaml
# /etc/kronk/model_config.yaml

unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0:
  context-window: 32768
  nseq-max: 4
  cache-type-k: q8_0
  cache-type-v: q8_0
  incremental-cache: true
```
