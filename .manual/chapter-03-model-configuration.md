Model configuration controls how Kronk configures models to run inference.
There are exactly two ways to configure a model:

1. **`~/.kronk/model_config.yaml`** — per-model overrides keyed by model id,
   used by the model server and any tool that goes through
   `models.KronkResolvedConfig`.
2. **`model.Config` (Go struct)** — passed directly to `kronk.New(cfg)` when
   you embed the SDK in your own application.

The catalog (`~/.kronk/catalog.yaml`) is **not** a source of tuning knobs —
it is a resolution cache (provider, family, revision, files). All tuning
described in this chapter lives in `model_config.yaml` or `model.Config`.

### 3.1 Basic Configuration

For most models you will want to touch these basic settings. There are many more
which will be presented later. Each model has GGUF metadata that Kronk can read
for defaults like setting the context window size when not provided. Kronk also
has default settings for things like `temperature` and `top_p` when not provided.

#### Context Window

The context window is the maximum number of tokens the KV cache can hold, and it's
consumed by both input tokens (system prompt, user messages) and output tokens
(model responses). Once the cumulative tokens from all inputs and outputs in a
session reach the context window limit, the model can't process more without some
form of truncation, sliding window, or cache eviction.

```yaml
context_window: 8192 # This represent 8192 tokens.
```

_Note: A common rule of thumb is that 1 token ≈ 0.75 words (or roughly 4
characters in English). So an 8K context window can handle approximately 6,000
words of combined input and output._

Larger context windows require more VRAM for the KV cache. The actual cost
depends on the model's layer count, number of KV heads, head dimension, KV
cache data type (f16, q8_0, q4_0), and the number of parallel sequences (slots).

As a rough guide for a single slot for a given model size:

| Context Size | ~7B (q8_0) | ~7B (f16) | ~70B (q8_0) | ~70B (f16) |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 8K           | ~0.5 GB    | ~1 GB     | ~1.25 GB    | ~2.5 GB    |
| 32K          | ~2 GB      | ~4 GB     | ~5 GB       | ~10 GB     |
| 128K         | ~8 GB      | ~16 GB    | ~20 GB      | ~40 GB     |

Using q4_0 KV cache quantization can reduce costs further to roughly ¼ of f16.

128K context typically requires YaRN scaling for models not natively trained
at that length.

_Note: YaRN is a way to extend the natural size of context windows for
small models. Kronk supports YaRN and talked about in Chapter 6._

#### Batch Size Configuration

When you send a prompt to a model, the model doesn't process all your input
tokens at once. It breaks them into smaller chunks and processes each chunk
through the GPU in a series of steps called forward passes. These two
parameters control the size of those chunks:

- `n_batch` - Maximum tokens per decode call (kronk default: 2048)
- `n_ubatch` - GPU compute chunk size within each decode call (kronk default: 512)

**`n_batch` is the capacity of the work tray** — the maximum number of tokens
you can load onto the tray before handing it to the GPU. When the batch engine
is running multiple slots in parallel (NSeqMax > 1), all their tokens share
this tray.

**`n_ubatch` is the GPU's bite size** — when the tray arrives at the GPU, it
doesn't process all the tokens at once. It chews through them in
`n_ubatch`-sized bites. This is a hardware optimization: different GPUs have
different optimal bite sizes based on their memory architecture.

**`n_ubatch` also controls fair sharing of the tray.** When multiple slots need
prefill, the batch engine uses `n_ubatch` as the round-robin chunk size. It
pulls up to `n_ubatch` tokens from slot 0, then up to `n_ubatch` from slot 1,
then slot 2, and so on — cycling through until the tray is full. This prevents
one slot's large prefill from starving the others.

The flow works like this:

1. Add generation tokens from all active slots (1 token each — always fits)
2. Round-robin prefill: pull `n_ubatch` tokens from each prefilling slot in
   turn until the tray reaches `n_batch` capacity
3. Hand tray to the GPU
4. GPU processes the tray in `n_ubatch`-sized bites

For example, with 4 prefilling slots, `n_batch: 4096`, and `n_ubatch: 512`,
each round pulls 512 tokens from S0, then S1, then S2, then S3, then back
to S0 — giving each slot 1024 tokens per tray instead of one slot consuming
all 4096.

For example, if you send a 4096-token prompt with `n_batch: 2048` and
`n_ubatch: 512`, the prompt is split into 2 decode calls of 2048 tokens each.
Within each call, the GPU processes 512 tokens at a time — so each call
runs 4 compute passes internally. Larger values mean faster prompt processing
but use more VRAM. The `n_ubatch` value must always be less than or equal to
`n_batch`.

```yaml
n_batch: 2048 # Work tray capacity (must be ≥ n_ubatch)
n_ubatch: 512 # GPU bite size (must be ≤ n_batch)
```

#### Recommended settings by workload

| Workload                           | n_batch   | n_ubatch |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| Interactive chat (single user)     | 512-1024  | 512      |
| Long prompts/RAG                   | 2048-4096 | 512-1024 |
| Batch inference (multiple prompts) | 2048-4096 | 512      |
| Low VRAM (<8GB)                    | 512       | 256-512  |
| High VRAM (24GB+)                  | 4096+     | 1024+    |

### 3.2 Processor Selection

The **processor** determines which hardware backend Kronk uses for inference:
CPU, CUDA, Metal, ROCm, or Vulkan. Each processor corresponds to a different
build of the llama.cpp shared libraries, so the processor must be resolved
**before** libraries are downloaded. Once the wrong libraries are installed,
switching processors requires re-downloading them.

This means processor selection happens early — before `libs.New()` in the SDK,
and before `kronk libs` or any server startup on the CLI. Each install lands
in its own per-triple folder under the libraries root
(`<base>/libraries/<os>/<arch>/<processor>/`), so multiple processor bundles
can coexist; switch active install at runtime by exporting `KRONK_LIB_PATH` to
that folder and restarting the server. Everything downstream (model loading,
layer offloading, KV cache placement) depends on having the correct libraries
for your hardware.

#### How Processor Selection Works

Kronk resolves the processor through a two-step priority:

1. **Environment variable** — If `KRONK_PROCESSOR` is set (e.g., `cpu`, `cuda`,
   `metal`, `vulkan`, `rocm`), that value is used directly. This gives you
   explicit control and overrides all auto-detection.

2. **Auto-detection** — If `KRONK_PROCESSOR` is not set, Kronk calls
   `DetectGPU()` to probe your system for available GPU hardware and selects
   the best processor automatically.

```
KRONK_PROCESSOR set?
  ├─ Yes → Use that value
  └─ No  → DetectGPU()
              ├─ CUDA found?   → cuda
              ├─ ROCm found?   → rocm   (Linux only)
              ├─ Vulkan found? → vulkan
              └─ Nothing found → cpu
```

Auto-detection was introduced in release v1.21.5
so that Kronk selects the best available GPU automatically rather than silently
defaulting to CPU. Because hardware configurations vary widely, auto-detection
ensures GPU acceleration is enabled when supported — users who need a specific
backend can always override via `KRONK_PROCESSOR`.

For SDK users, `defaults.Processor("")` calls `DetectGPU()` internally. This
must be called before library initialization:

```go
lbs, err := libs.New(
    libs.WithVersion(defaults.LibVersion("")),
    libs.WithProcessor(defaults.Processor("")),
)
```

#### Platform Detection Details

Detection varies by platform because each operating system exposes GPU
information differently.

**macOS (Darwin)**

| Architecture | Result | Reason |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ |
| ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | `metal` | Native Metal support via unified memory |
| AMD64 (Intel Mac) | `cpu` | The x64 macOS `cpu` binary already includes Metal support |

On macOS, GPU detection is straightforward. Apple Silicon machines always use
Metal. Intel Macs return `cpu` because yzma's precompiled Metal libraries are
ARM64-only — but the x64 `cpu` binary already includes Metal acceleration, so
Intel Macs still get GPU support through the CPU processor selection.

**Windows**

| Priority | Check | Processor |
| -------- | ----- | --------- |
| 1 | `nvidia-smi` found | `cuda` |
| 2 | `vulkaninfo` or `vulkan-1.dll` present | `vulkan` |
| 3 | None | `cpu` |

**Linux**

| Priority | Check | Processor |
| -------- | ----- | --------- |
| 1 | `nvidia-smi` found | `cuda` |
| 2 | `rocminfo` found | `rocm` |
| 3 | `vulkaninfo --summary` succeeds | `vulkan` |
| 4 | None | `cpu` |

#### Supported Processors

| Processor | Hardware | Platforms | Notes |
| --------- | -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `metal` | Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) | macOS | Unified memory — CPU and GPU share RAM |
| `cuda` | NVIDIA discrete GPUs | Windows, Linux | Requires NVIDIA drivers with `nvidia-smi` |
| `rocm` | AMD discrete GPUs | Linux | Requires ROCm runtime with `rocminfo` |
| `vulkan` | Cross-platform GPUs | Windows, Linux | Intel, AMD, NVIDIA — including integrated GPUs |
| `cpu` | Any | All | No GPU acceleration, uses system RAM only |

#### Integrated GPUs (iGPUs)

Machines without a discrete GPU but with an integrated GPU (Intel UHD/Iris, AMD
APU) will auto-detect as `vulkan` if Vulkan drivers are installed.

_**Warning:** On systems with low RAM (8GB or less) or older integrated GPUs,
Vulkan may perform worse than CPU-only inference. Integrated GPUs share system
RAM with the CPU, and the overhead of GPU dispatch may outweigh any acceleration
benefit. If you suspect this applies to your hardware, benchmark both options
and override with `KRONK_PROCESSOR=cpu` if CPU performs better._

### 3.3 GPU Configuration

A model is made up of layers, and each layer contains the weights (numbers)
the model learned during training. When you run inference, the model processes
your input through these layers one at a time. The key performance question is:
where do those layers live — on the GPU or the CPU?

GPUs are dramatically faster at the math required for inference, but they have
limited memory (VRAM). If your model doesn't fit entirely in VRAM, you can
split the work: keep some layers on the GPU for speed and let the rest run on
the CPU. This section covers how to control that split and other GPU-related
settings.

#### Layer Offloading

A typical model might have anywhere from 28 to 80+ layers depending on its
size. For example, a 7B parameter model usually has around 32 layers, while a
70B model might have 80. Each layer you place on the GPU runs significantly
faster, but consumes VRAM. If your GPU doesn't have enough VRAM to hold every
layer, you can choose how many to offload — the rest will run on the CPU,
which is slower but has access to your full system RAM.

The goal is to put as many layers on the GPU as your VRAM allows. If you run
out of VRAM, lower this number until the model fits.

Control how many model layers run on GPU:

```yaml
n_gpu_layers: 0      # 0 = all layers on GPU (default)
n_gpu_layers: -1     # All layers on CPU
n_gpu_layers: 20     # First 20 layers on GPU
```

_Note: On Apple Silicon (Metal), the CPU and GPU share the same unified
memory pool, so there is no separate VRAM. All layers run on the GPU by
default and this setting does not need to be configured. Layer offloading
applies to discrete GPU systems (NVIDIA CUDA, Vulkan)._

#### KV Cache Location

As the model processes your conversation, it builds up a cache of intermediate
calculations called the KV (Key-Value) cache. Think of it as the model's
short-term memory — it stores what the model has already "read" so it doesn't
have to reprocess the entire conversation for every new token it generates.
The longer the conversation, the larger this cache grows.

By default the KV cache lives on the GPU for speed, but it can consume a
significant amount of VRAM — especially with large context windows or multiple
concurrent requests. If you're running low on VRAM, moving the KV cache to
the CPU frees up GPU memory at the cost of slower inference.

Control where the KV cache is stored:

```yaml
offload_kqv: true    # KV cache on GPU (default, faster)
offload_kqv: false   # KV cache on CPU (saves VRAM, slower)
```

_Note: On Apple Silicon (Metal), the CPU and GPU share unified memory, so
this setting has no practical effect. KV cache location applies to discrete GPU
systems (NVIDIA CUDA, Vulkan)._

#### Tensor Operations Offload

Beyond the model layers and KV cache, there are additional math operations
(called tensor operations) that happen during inference — things like
matrix multiplications and attention score calculations. These operations
are separate from the layer weights themselves and can independently be
placed on the GPU or CPU. By default they run on the GPU, but if VRAM is
tight you can move them to the CPU while still keeping your model layers
on the GPU.

Control where these tensor computations run:

```yaml
op_offload: true     # Tensor ops on GPU (default)
op_offload: false    # Tensor ops on CPU
```

_Note: On Apple Silicon (Metal), the CPU and GPU share unified memory, so
this setting has no practical effect. Offloading applies to discrete GPU
systems (NVIDIA CUDA, Vulkan)._

#### Multi-GPU Split Mode

If you have more than one GPU in your system, you can spread a model across
them. This is useful when a model is too large to fit in a single GPU's VRAM.
There are two strategies,`layer mode` and `row mode`.

`layer mode` assigns entire layers to different GPUs
(simple and works well for most models).

`row mode` splits individual tensor operations across GPUs in parallel (better
for Mixture of Experts models like Qwen3-MoE, Mixtral, or DeepSeek where different
"experts" can run simultaneously on different GPUs).

Control how the model is distributed across GPUs:

```yaml
split_mode: none     # Single GPU (default)
split_mode: layer    # Split layers across GPUs
split_mode: row      # Tensor parallelism (best for MoE models)
```

_Note: Use this setting for Mixture of Experts models like Qwen3-MoE, Mixtral, or
DeepSeek._

#### Configuration Reference

Here is a chart for all these GPU settings. These only apply to discrete GPU systems
(NVIDIA CUDA, Vulkan). On Apple Silicon, the CPU and GPU share unified memory and
these settings can be ignored.

| Field      | YAML Key       | Values         | Default | Description                    |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| NGpuLayers | `n_gpu_layers` | 0, -1, N       | 0       | Layers on GPU (0=all, -1=none) |
| OffloadKQV | `offload_kqv`  | true/false     | true    | KV cache on GPU                |
| OpOffload  | `op_offload`   | true/false     | true    | Tensor ops on GPU              |
| SplitMode  | `split_mode`   | none/layer/row | none    | Multi-GPU distribution         |

### 3.4 KV Cache Quantization

As discussed in the previous section, the KV cache is the model's short-term
memory of your conversation. By default it stores values in half precision
(f16), which gives the best accuracy but uses the most VRAM. Quantization
reduces the precision of those stored values — using fewer bits to represent
each number. It's a trade-off: you lose a small amount of accuracy in
exchange for meaningful VRAM savings. For most use cases, `q8_0` (8-bit)
gives nearly identical output quality while cutting KV cache memory by about
25%. More aggressive options like `q4_0` save even more but can start to
affect generation quality.

Control the precision of the key and value caches independently:

```yaml
cache_type_k: q8_0 # Key cache precision
cache_type_v: q8_0 # Value cache precision
```

#### Available types

- `f16` - Half precision (default, best quality)
- `q8_0` - 8-bit quantization (good balance)
- `q4_0` - 4-bit quantization (aggressive, may affect quality)
- `bf16` - Brain float 16 (for supported hardware)

#### When to use f16 vs q8_0

| Consideration       | f16 (default)                                    | q8_0                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| VRAM usage          | Higher                                           | ~50% less for KV cache                                    |
| Output quality      | Best possible                                    | Nearly identical for most tasks                           |
| MoE models          | Recommended — routing is sensitive to precision  | May degrade expert routing decisions                      |
| Dense models        | Safe but uses more memory                        | Recommended — minimal quality loss with good VRAM savings |
| Long-context (64K+) | Safer — avoids compounding                       | Small precision errors can                                |
|                     | precision errors                                 | accumulate over long sequences                            |

Start with `q8_0` for dense models. Use `f16` for MoE models or if you
notice quality issues (incoherent outputs, reasoning failures).

#### Example: MoE Model with F16 Cache

```yaml
models:
  # MoE models benefit from f16 cache for routing accuracy
  Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Q8_0:
    context_window: 32768
    cache_type_k: f16 # Preserve routing precision
    cache_type_v: f16
    split_mode: row # Best for MoE multi-GPU

  # Dense models can often use q8_0 cache without issues
  Qwen3-8B-Q8_0:
    context_window: 32768
    cache_type_k: q8_0
    cache_type_v: q8_0
```

**Recommendation:** If you notice quality degradation (incoherent outputs,
reasoning failures, or code bugs) with quantized cache, try `f16` first
before adjusting other parameters. The VRAM cost is typically 25-50% more
for the cache, but the quality improvement for sensitive workloads is
substantial.

### 3.5 Flash Attention

> **TL;DR (new to this?)** Flash Attention is a speed trick for the
> **transformer attention layers** in an LLM — the part that figures out
> "how much should each word pay attention to every other word." It works
> by being clever about how it uses fast on-chip memory so it doesn't
> have to write huge intermediate results to slower memory. It's on by
> default. Most models support it; **hybrid models do not** (see the note
> at the end of this section).

Attention is the core mechanism that lets a model figure out which parts of
your input are relevant to each other. For example, in the sentence "The cat
sat on the mat because it was tired," attention is how the model connects
"it" back to "the cat." The standard attention algorithm needs to hold a
large matrix of scores in memory — one score for every pair of tokens in your
input. As context windows grow, this matrix grows quadratically and can
become both slow and memory-hungry.

Flash Attention is an optimized implementation that computes the same result
but processes the matrix in small tiles that fit in the GPU's fast on-chip
memory (SRAM) instead of slower VRAM. The result is lower memory usage and
faster computation — especially noticeable with large context windows (32K+).
It's enabled by default and should rarely need to be changed.

Control whether Flash Attention is used:

```yaml
flash_attention: enabled   # Default: enabled
flash_attention: disabled  # Disable if causing issues
flash_attention: auto      # Let llama.cpp decide
```

_Note: **Hybrid models** mix two kinds of layers: regular transformer
attention layers _and_ a different kind (like Mamba or convolutional
layers in models such as Jamba, Granite-Hybrid, or LFM2) that don't do
attention at all — they have their own way of remembering past tokens.
Flash Attention only knows how to speed up the attention layers, and the
way llama.cpp is wired you can only turn Flash Attention on for the
**whole model** at once, not layer-by-layer. So if you turn it on for a
hybrid model, llama.cpp tries to apply the trick to layers that don't
have attention, and things break or produce wrong answers. That's why
Kronk detects hybrid models and automatically disables it. Additionally,
quantized KV caches (`q8_0`, `q4_0`) require flash attention to
function — so when flash attention is disabled for hybrid models, Kronk
also forces the KV cache type to f16. These overrides happen regardless
of your configuration settings._

### 3.6 Sliding Window Attention (SWA)

Some models use a **mixed attention pattern** that interleaves sliding
window attention (SWA) layers with full global attention layers. In SWA
layers, each token only attends to a small local window of recent tokens
(e.g., 1024 tokens) rather than the entire context. The global attention
layers still see everything, which keeps the model coherent over long
contexts while the SWA layers provide efficient local processing.

> **Not the same as a "hybrid model".** SWA still uses transformer
> attention in every layer — some layers just attend to a smaller window
> than others. A "hybrid model" (Section 3.5) replaces some attention
> layers entirely with a non-attention mechanism like Mamba or
> convolutions. Flash Attention works fine with SWA; it does not work
> with hybrid models.

Models that use sliding window attention include:

| Model                | SWA Window | Architecture |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Gemma 4 26B-A4B      | 1024       | MoE          |
| Gemma 4 31B          | 1024       | Dense        |
| Gemma 4 E2B / E4B    | 512        | Dense        |
| Gemma 3 (all sizes)  | 1024       | Dense        |

Kronk automatically detects sliding window metadata from the GGUF file —
you don't need to configure the window size. By default, llama.cpp allocates
a compact KV cache for SWA layers (sized to the window), which saves
significant VRAM compared to allocating the full context window for every
layer. However, this compact cache prevents advanced operations like context
shifting and full prefix caching on SWA layers.

#### SWA Full Cache Mode

When accuracy is more important than memory savings, you can force SWA layers
to use the full context window for their KV cache:

```yaml
swa_full: true    # Full-size KV cache for SWA layers (more VRAM, better accuracy)
swa_full: false   # Compact SWA cache (default, less VRAM)
```

When `swa_full` is enabled, SWA layers allocate the same KV cache size as
global attention layers. This preserves all cached context for SWA layers
and enables full context shifting and prefix caching, but increases VRAM
usage proportionally.

#### VRAM Impact

The VRAM difference depends on what fraction of layers use SWA. For example,
Gemma 4 26B-A4B has 30 layers with a pattern where roughly 5/6 of attention
layers are SWA. With a 32K context window and f16 KV cache:

| Setting            | SWA Layer Cache | Approximate KV Savings |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| `swa_full: false`  | 1024 tokens     | ~40-50% less KV VRAM   |
| `swa_full: true`   | 32768 tokens    | None (full allocation) |

_Note: Not all models use sliding window attention. Dense models (Llama,
Qwen3, Mistral-large), hybrid models (Qwen3.5/3.6), and most MoE models
(Qwen3-MoE, DeepSeek) use full attention on all layers. The `swa_full`
setting has no effect on these models._

### 3.7 Parallel Inference (NSeqMax)

When multiple users (or applications) send requests to the same model at the
same time, the model needs a way to handle them concurrently. That's what
`NSeqMax` controls — it determines how many requests the model can process in
parallel.

Behind the scenes, when a model is loaded, Kronk creates one processing slot
for each unit of `n_seq_max` (e.g., `n_seq_max: 4` creates four slots).
Each slot gets its own isolated partition in the KV cache (the model's
short-term memory from earlier sections). All slots share the same model weights
and GPU, but each one maintains its own conversation state independently.

Consider what happens when `n_seq_max` is set to 1 and two requests arrive.
The first request is assigned to the only available slot and begins
generating tokens. The second request has no slot available, so it waits in
a queue. Once the first request finishes and the slot is released, the
second request is assigned to that slot and begins processing. With a single
slot, requests are handled one at a time.

When `n_seq_max` is set to 4, then four requests can each be assigned a slot
at the same time and generate tokens simultaneously. Kronk combines the next
token from each active slot into a single batch and sends that batch through
the GPU in one forward pass — so the GPU processes all four tokens together
rather than one at a time. That's where we get some performance optimization.

The trade-off is VRAM. Each slot reserves its full KV cache partition when the
model loads, whether or not it's actively handling a request. Setting
`n_seq_max: 4` means four KV cache partitions are allocated upfront. If each
partition costs 3 GB, that's 12 GB of VRAM just for the cache — on top of the
model weights. More slots means more concurrency but more VRAM.

Control how many requests can be processed in parallel:

```yaml
n_seq_max: 4 # Process up to 4 requests concurrently
```

#### How Caching Strategy Affects Slot Behavior

Enabling a [caching strategy](#chapter-5-message-caching) does not add any
extra memory to the system — caching works within the KV cache already
allocated to each slot. The difference between strategies is what happens to
the data in the KV cache between requests:

**No Caching** — The simplest mode. When a request finishes, the slot's KV
cache is cleared. The next request that lands in that slot starts from
scratch, processing the full prompt from the beginning. Every request pays
the full cost of prompt processing regardless of how similar it is to a
previous one.

**IMC (Incremental Message Cache)** — Designed for single-user, multi-turn
conversations. IMC maintains logical sessions that cache the conversation
history. All sessions (text and media) externalize their cached KV state to
RAM after each request and restore it into any available slot on the next
request — slots are not dedicated to conversations. When the user sends a
new message, only the new tokens need to be processed — the model doesn't
re-read the entire conversation. This gives the best performance for chat
and agentic applications.

| Mode | Session Lifetime          | Best For    | Cache Strategy                                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Off  | Cleared after request     | Stateless   | None                                                                     |
| IMC  | Persists across requests  | Single-user | Conversation cached in session; externalizes to RAM between requests      |

#### Embedding and Reranking Models

Embedding and reranking models work differently. Instead of slots sharing a
single context, `NSeqMax` creates a pool of independent contexts. When a
request contains multiple inputs (for example, 100 sentences to embed), those
inputs are spread across the pool contexts and processed in parallel. Model
weights are shared, but each context has its own KV cache memory.

### 3.8 Understanding GGUF Quantization

GGUF models come in various quantization formats that trade off between file
size, VRAM usage, and output quality. Understanding these formats helps you
choose the right model variant for your hardware and use case.

#### What is Quantization?

Quantization reduces model precision from the original 16-bit or 32-bit
floating-point weights to lower bit representations. This dramatically
decreases:

- **File size** - A 7B model can go from ~14GB (FP16) to ~3GB (Q4)
- **VRAM usage** - More aggressive quantization allows larger models on limited hardware
- **Inference speed** - Smaller models load faster and may run faster on memory-constrained systems

The tradeoff is **quality degradation** - lower precision means less accurate
representations of the original weights, which can affect output coherence,
reasoning ability and factual accuracy.

#### What are K-Quants?

K-quants (introduced by llama.cpp) use **per-block scaling** with importance
weighting. Instead of applying uniform quantization across all weights, K-quants:

1. Divide weights into small blocks (typically 32 or 256 values)
2. Calculate optimal scale factors per block
3. Preserve more precision for important weights

This produces better quality than naive quantization at the same bit rate.
K-quant variants include size suffixes:

- **S** (Small) - Smallest file size, lowest quality within that bit level
- **M** (Medium) - Balanced size and quality
- **L** (Large) - Larger file, better quality

#### Standard Quantization Formats

| Format     | Bits/Weight | Quality     | VRAM (7B Model) | Use Case                                     |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Q4_0**   | 4.5         | Low         | ~4 GB           | Maximum compression, quality loss noticeable |
| **Q4_1**   | 5.0         | Low-Med     | ~4.3 GB         | Slightly better than Q4_0                    |
| **Q4_K_S** | 4.5         | Medium      | ~4 GB           | K-quant, good balance for limited VRAM       |
| **Q4_K_M** | 4.8         | Medium      | ~4.5 GB         | K-quant, recommended 4-bit option            |
| **Q5_K_S** | 5.5         | Medium-High | ~5 GB           | Good quality, moderate size                  |
| **Q5_K_M** | 5.7         | High        | ~5.3 GB         | Recommended for most users                   |
| **Q6_K**   | 6.5         | High        | ~6 GB           | Near-original quality                        |
| **Q8_0**   | 8.5         | Highest     | ~8 GB           | Best quality, largest size                   |

#### IQ (Importance Matrix) Quantization

IQ formats use **learned importance matrices** to determine which weights
matter most. They achieve extreme compression with minimal quality loss by:

1. Analyzing weight importance during quantization
2. Allocating more bits to critical weights
3. Aggressively compressing less important weights

| Format      | Bits/Weight | Quality     | Use Case                          |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| **IQ1_S**   | ~1.5        | Very Low    | Extreme compression, experimental |
| **IQ1_M**   | ~1.75       | Low         | Extreme compression, experimental |
| **IQ2_XXS** | ~2.0        | Low         | Ultra-low VRAM situations         |
| **IQ2_XS**  | ~2.3        | Low-Med     | Very constrained hardware         |
| **IQ2_S**   | ~2.5        | Medium      | Constrained hardware              |
| **IQ3_XXS** | ~3.0        | Medium      | Good balance for low VRAM         |
| **IQ3_XS**  | ~3.3        | Medium-High | Better quality low-bit option     |
| **IQ4_XS**  | ~4.0        | High        | Alternative to Q4_K variants      |

#### UD (Ultra-Dynamic) Quantization

UD quantization applies **different precision levels per layer**. Neural
network layers have varying sensitivity to quantization:

- Early layers (embeddings, first attention blocks) - More sensitive
- Middle layers - Moderately sensitive
- Later layers - Often more tolerant of compression

UD variants analyze each layer and assign optimal bit depths, achieving
better quality than uniform quantization at similar average bits per weight.

Common UD naming: `UD-Q5_K_XL` means Ultra-Dynamic with Q5 K-quant base, XL quality tier.

### 3.9 Choosing the Right Quantization

The right quantization depends on how much VRAM you have and what quality you need.

#### By Available VRAM

| VRAM   | 7B Model | 13B Model | 30B Model | 70B Model |
| ------ | -------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| 6 GB   | Q4_K_M   | IQ3_XXS   | -         | -         |
| 8 GB   | Q6_K     | Q4_K_M    | IQ2_XXS   | -         |
| 12 GB  | Q8_0     | Q5_K_M    | IQ3_XXS   | -         |
| 16 GB  | Q8_0     | Q8_0      | Q4_K_M    | -         |
| 24 GB  | Q8_0     | Q8_0      | Q6_K      | IQ3_XXS   |
| 48 GB  | Q8_0     | Q8_0      | Q8_0      | Q4_K_M    |
| 64 GB+ | Q8_0     | Q8_0      | Q8_0      | Q6_K/Q8_0 |

#### By Use Case

- **Production/Quality-Critical**: Q8_0 or Q6_K - Minimal quality loss
- **General Use**: Q5_K_M - Best balance of quality and efficiency
- **VRAM-Constrained**: Q4_K_M - Good quality at low VRAM cost
- **Experimental/Testing**: IQ3_XXS or IQ2_XS - Run larger models on limited hardware

#### Quality Guidelines

1. **Start with Q5_K_M** - It's the sweet spot for most use cases
2. **Use Q8_0 for reasoning-heavy tasks** - Math, code, complex logic benefit from higher precision
3. **Q4_K_M is the floor** - Below this, quality degrades noticeably for most models
4. **IQ formats are specialized** - Great for running models that wouldn't otherwise fit, but expect some quality loss
5. **Larger models at lower quant often beat smaller models at higher quant** - A 70B Q4 may outperform a 7B Q8

#### Example Configuration

```yaml
models:
  # Quality-focused: Q8_0 for a model that fits in VRAM
  Qwen3-8B-Q8_0:
    context_window: 32768
    cache_type_k: q8_0
    cache_type_v: q8_0

  # VRAM-constrained: Q4_K_M to fit larger model
  Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Q4_K_M:
    context_window: 8192
    split_mode: row
    n_gpu_layers: 0
```

### 3.10 VRAM Estimation

Before loading a model, you need to know whether it will fit in your GPU's
memory. VRAM usage comes from two things: the model weights (fixed cost
determined by the model you chose) and the KV cache (variable cost determined
by your configuration choices from the previous sections — context window size,
number of slots, and cache precision). If the total exceeds your available
VRAM, the model either won't load or will partially fall back to the CPU,
which significantly slows inference. This section walks through how to
estimate the total.

#### Model Weights + KV Cache

Model weights are the learned numerical parameters (billions of floating-point values)
that encode the model's knowledge and reasoning ability — they represent the fixed
cost of loading a model into memory. Model weights are determined by the GGUF file
size (e.g., ~8GB for a 7B Q8_0 model). The KV cache is the variable cost you
control through configuration. Together they determine total VRAM usage:

Total VRAM = Model Weights + KV Cache.

#### Model Weights (Q8_0 quantization)

The following table provides rough VRAM estimates for model weights at Q8_0
quantization, grouped by parameter count.

| Parameters | VRAM     |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 1-3B       | 2-4 GB   |
| 7-8B       | 8-10 GB  |
| 13B        | 14-16 GB |
| 30B        | 32-36 GB |
| 70B        | 72-80 GB |

#### Slots and Sequences

A slot is a processing unit that handles one request at a time. Each slot is
assigned a unique sequence ID that maps to an isolated partition in the shared
KV cache. The mapping is always 1:1 in Kronk.

```
NSeqMax = 4 (set via n_seq_max in model config)

Slot 0  →  Sequence 0  →  KV cache partition 0
Slot 1  →  Sequence 1  →  KV cache partition 1
Slot 2  →  Sequence 2  →  KV cache partition 2
Slot 3  →  Sequence 3  →  KV cache partition 3
```

Remember as shared previously, `NSeqMax` controls how many slots (and sequences)
are created. More slots means more concurrent requests, but each slot reserves
its own KV cache partition in VRAM whether or not it is actively used.

#### What Affects KV Cache Memory Per Sequence

Each sequence's KV cache partition size is determined by three factors:

| Factor             | Config Key          | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Context Window     | `n_ctx`             | Maximum tokens the sequence can hold. Memory scales linearly — 32K context uses 4× the memory of 8K.                                                          |
| Number of Layers   | `block_count`       | Every transformer layer stores its own key and value tensors per token. A 70B model (80 layers) uses ~2.5× more per-token memory than a 7B model (32 layers). |
| KV Cache Precision | `bytes_per_element` | Data type for cached keys and values: `f16` = 2 bytes/element (default, best quality), `q8_0` = 1 byte/element (50% VRAM savings, good quality).              |

The remaining values (`head_count_kv`, `key_length`, `value_length`) are baked
into the model itself and cannot be changed — Kronk reads them automatically
from the GGUF file.

The formula:

```
KV_Per_Token_Per_Layer = head_count_kv × (key_length + value_length) × bytes_per_element
KV_Per_Sequence        = n_ctx × n_layers × KV_Per_Token_Per_Layer
```

#### What Affects Total KV Cache (Slot Memory)

Total KV cache (Slot Memory) is the per-sequence cost multiplied by the number
of slots:

```
Slot_Memory = NSeqMax × KV_Per_Sequence
Total_VRAM  = Model_Weights + Slot_Memory
```

Memory is statically allocated upfront when the model loads. All slots reserve
their full KV cache partition regardless of whether they are actively processing
a request.

#### Example: Real Model Calculation

```
Model                   : Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Q8_0
Model Weights           : 36.0 GB
Context Window (n_ctx)  : 131,072 (128K)
Bytes Per Element       : 1 (q8_0)
block_count (n_layers)  : 48
attention.head_count_kv : 4
attention.key_length    : 128
attention.value_length  : 128

Step 1 — Per-token-per-layer cost:

  KV_Per_Token_Per_Layer = 4 × (128 + 128) × 1 = 1,024 bytes

Step 2 — Per-sequence cost:

  KV_Per_Sequence = 131,072 × 48 × 1,024 = ~6.4 GB

Step 3 — Total KV cache (NSeqMax = 2):

  Slot_Memory = 2 × 6.4 GB = ~12.8 GB

Step 4 — Total VRAM:

  Total_VRAM = 36.0 GB + 12.8 GB = ~48.8 GB
```

### 3.11 Model-Specific Tuning

The previous sections covered general configuration that applies to all
models. However, different model architectures — Dense, Mixture of Experts
(MoE), and Hybrid — each have their own characteristics that benefit from
specific tuning. Vision and audio models also need adjusted batch settings
because they process media as large token batches. This section provides
recommended configurations for each model type so you can get the best
performance out of the box.

#### Dense Models

Dense models are the most common architecture. Every parameter participates
in every token, producing sequential memory access patterns that saturate
bandwidth efficiently. No special configuration is needed — the defaults
from the previous sections apply directly.

| Do                                        | Don't                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Use `q8_0` KV cache to save VRAM          | Use `f16` cache unless you need maximum quality |
| Start with default `n_batch` / `n_ubatch` | Over-tune batch settings without benchmarking   |
| Use flash attention when available        | Disable flash attention without reason          |

#### MoE Models

MoE (Mixture of Experts) models have many total parameters but only activate
a small subset per token. For example, `Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B` has 30B total
parameters but only 3B are active per token (that's what "A3B" means).

| Do                                                              | Don't                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Use `split_mode: row` for multi-GPU                             | Use `split_mode: layer` — it doesn't suit MoE routing |
| Start with `q8_0` KV cache, fall back to `f16` if quality drops | Assume `q8_0` cache works for all MoE models          |
| Prefer dense Q4 over MoE Q8 on Apple Silicon                    | Assume fewer active parameters means faster inference |

_Note: On unified memory systems (like Apple Silicon), inference speed depends on
memory bandwidth, not compute. MoE models create scattered memory access
patterns (jumping between expert weights) that underutilize bandwidth
compared to the sequential access of dense models. A dense model at Q4 may
outperform a larger MoE at Q8 on Apple Silicon — fewer total bytes moved and
a more efficient access pattern._

#### Hybrid Models

Hybrid models mix traditional attention layers with recurrent layers
(DeltaNet or SSM/Mamba). Like dense models, every parameter participates in
every token. Kronk detects hybrid models automatically at load time.

| Do                                                    | Don't                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use `f16` for both `cache_type_k` and `cache_type_v`  | Use `q8_0` cache — it's incompatible with recurrent layers  |
| Enable `incremental_cache` for conversation workloads | Manually enable flash attention — Kronk disables it for you |
| Budget extra VRAM for the larger f16 KV cache         | Expect the same KV cache savings as dense models            |

See [IMC Hybrid](#imc-hybrid) for details on how caching works with
recurrent state.

#### Vision and Audio Models

Vision and audio models process media (image tiles, audio frames) as large
token batches. Low `n_ubatch` values force multiple decode passes per image
or audio clip, significantly slowing inference.

| Do                                                      | Don't                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set `n_ubatch` high (2048+) to match media token volume | Leave `n_ubatch` at low defaults — it causes multiple decode passes |
| Match `n_batch` to `n_ubatch` for media workloads       | Set `n_seq_max` high — media processing is memory-intensive         |

#### Embedding Models

Embedding models process complete inputs in a single pass rather than
generating tokens one at a time.

| Do                                               | Don't                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Set `n_batch` high (up to `context_window`)      | Use small `n_batch` — it limits throughput     |
| Use multiple slots (`n_seq_max`) for concurrency | Over-allocate slots beyond your request volume |

#### SWA Models

Models with sliding window attention (Gemma 4, Gemma 3) interleave local
SWA layers with global attention layers. By default, SWA layers use a compact
KV cache sized to the sliding window (e.g., 1024 tokens), which saves
significant VRAM. Enable `swa_full` when accuracy matters more than memory.

| Do                                                        | Don't                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable `swa_full: true` when accuracy is the priority     | Enable `swa_full` on models without SWA — it has no effect     |
| Use `f16` KV cache for MoE SWA models (e.g., Gemma 4)    | Assume `swa_full` is needed — test without it first            |
| Budget extra VRAM when `swa_full` is enabled              | Use large context windows + `swa_full` without checking VRAM   |

```yaml
# Example: Gemma 4 26B-A4B with full SWA cache
unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-UD-Q4_K_M:
  context-window: 32768
  swa-full: true
  incremental-cache: true
```

### 3.12 Speculative Decoding

Speculative decoding uses a small, fast "draft" model to predict candidate
tokens, then verifies them against the full "target" model in a single forward
pass. When the draft model's predictions match the target's, multiple tokens
are accepted per decode step — improving throughput without changing output
quality. The output distribution is mathematically guaranteed to match the
target model exactly, regardless of draft quality (Leviathan et al., 2023).

#### How It Works

| Step      | What Happens                                                                                       |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Draft  | The draft model generates N candidate tokens (default 5)                                           |
| 2. Batch  | All candidates plus the last accepted token are decoded by the target model in one forward pass    |
| 3. Verify | Each candidate is accepted with probability `min(1, p_target / q_draft)`                           |
| 4. Reject | On rejection, a corrective token is sampled from the target and remaining candidates are discarded |
| 5. Bonus  | If all candidates are accepted, a bonus token is sampled from the target                           |

The speedup depends on the draft model's acceptance rate. Higher acceptance
means more tokens per forward pass.

| Factor              | Effect on Acceptance Rate                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Draft model quality | Larger, more capable drafts produce better predictions. Q4 of the same architecture tends to outperform a much smaller model. |
| Temperature         | Lower temperatures yield higher acceptance. At 0.8, expect ~30% of steps to accept zero draft tokens.                         |
| Task type           | Predictable text (boilerplate, common patterns) accepts more often than creative or reasoning-heavy output.                   |

#### Requirements

- Draft and target models must share the **same vocabulary** (same tokenizer)
- `n_seq_max` must be `1` (single-slot mode only)
- The draft model must be downloaded and available locally
- Only text generation is supported (not vision/audio)

#### Configuration

Speculative decoding is configured via the `draft-model` block under a
target model entry in `model_config.yaml` (or via `model.Config.DraftModel`
when you embed the SDK directly):

```yaml
# In ~/.kronk/model_config.yaml

#### Draft Model Selection

Choose a draft model that shares the same tokenizer family as the target.
A quantized version of the same architecture at lower precision works well:

| Target Model            | Recommended Draft          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Qwen3-8B-Q8_0           | Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0            |
| Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Q8_K_XL | Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-UD-Q2_K_XL |

The second example uses the same MoE architecture at lower quantization,
which shares more of the target's weight structure and produces higher
acceptance rates than a smaller dense model.

#### Performance Characteristics

Speculative decoding helps most when the target model is large relative to the
draft. For dense models where the target is already fast (e.g., 8B at 33+ TPS),
the overhead of running a draft model may not provide a net speedup. MoE models
with large parameter counts but sparse activation (e.g., 30B-A3B) are better
candidates, but only when using a high-quality draft.

The `ndraft` parameter controls how many candidates to generate. Higher values
increase the potential speedup but also increase wasted work when predictions
are rejected. The default of 5 is a good starting point; tune based on your
observed acceptance rates.

### 3.13 Sampling Parameters

Sampling parameters control the randomness and quality of generated text.
These are set per-request in the API call.

For most models you will want to touch these basic sampling parameters. There
are [many more](chapter-09-request-parameters.md) which will be presented later.

#### Temperature

Temperature controls how "random" the model's output is. At each step, the
model produces a probability distribution over all possible next tokens.
Temperature scales those probabilities — lower values sharpen the
distribution (making the top choice dominant), higher values flatten it
(giving lower-ranked tokens a better chance of being selected).

```json
{
  "temperature": 0.8
}
```

- `0.0 - 0.3` - Focused, deterministic (good for code, factual Q&A)
- `0.5 - 0.8` - Balanced (good for general chat)
- `0.9 - 1.2` - Creative (good for storytelling, brainstorming)

#### Top-K and Top-P

After temperature adjusts the probability distribution, Top-K and Top-P
narrow the pool of tokens the model can choose from. They work together —
Top-K sets a hard cap on how many tokens to consider, and Top-P trims that
pool further by cumulative probability.

```json
{
  "top_k": 40,
  "top_p": 0.9
}
```

- `top_k` - Consider only the K most probable tokens (default: 40). Lower values make output more focused, higher values allow more variety.
- `top_p` - After Top-K filtering, keep only enough tokens so their combined probability reaches P (default: 0.9). This removes the long tail of unlikely tokens while adapting to how confident the model is at each step.

#### Repetition Control

Models sometimes get stuck in loops, repeating the same word, phrase, or
sentence pattern. Repetition penalty discourages this by reducing the
probability of tokens that have already appeared in recent output.

```json
{
  "repeat_penalty": 1.1,
  "repeat_last_n": 64
}
```

- `repeat_penalty` - How strongly to penalize repeated tokens. `1.0` means no penalty, `1.1` is a mild penalty that works well for most use cases. Values above `1.3` can start to make output sound unnatural.
- `repeat_last_n` - How many recent tokens to check for repeats (default: 64). A larger window catches longer repeated patterns but may over-penalize common words like "the" or "is."

#### DRY Sampler (Don't Repeat Yourself)

DRY is a more targeted approach to repetition than `repeat_penalty`. Instead
of penalizing individual repeated tokens, it detects repeated n-gram
sequences (multi-word patterns) and penalizes them with an exponentially
increasing cost. This catches structural repetition — like repeated
sentences or paragraphs — while leaving single-word reuse alone.

```json
{
  "dry_multiplier": 1.05,
  "dry_base": 1.75,
  "dry_allowed_length": 2
}
```

- `dry_multiplier` - Strength of the penalty. `0` disables DRY. Start with `1.05` and increase if you still see repeated patterns.
- `dry_base` - Controls how fast the penalty grows for longer repeated sequences. Higher values penalize longer repeats more aggressively.
- `dry_allowed_length` - N-grams up to this length are allowed to repeat without penalty (default: 2). This prevents penalizing common short phrases like "of the" or "it is."

#### Max Tokens

Controls the maximum number of tokens the model will generate in a single
response. Once the limit is reached, generation stops. This is useful for
controlling costs, response time, and preventing runaway output.

```json
{
  "max_tokens": 2048
}
```

If not set, the model will generate until it produces a stop token or
reaches the context window limit.

### 3.14 Model Config File Example

`~/.kronk/model_config.yaml` is a flat map keyed by canonical model id
(`provider/modelID`, optionally with a `/variant` suffix). Each entry's
fields use kebab-case YAML keys that map 1:1 to `model.Config`:

```yaml
# ~/.kronk/model_config.yaml

Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Q8_0:
  context-window: 32768
  nbatch: 2048
  nubatch: 512
  nseq-max: 2
  cache-type-k: q8_0
  cache-type-v: q8_0
  flash-attention: enabled
  incremental-cache: true
  sampling-parameters:
    temperature: 0.7
    top_p: 0.8
    top_k: 20

Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Q8_0/YARN:
  context-window: 131072
  rope-scaling-type: yarn
  yarn-orig-ctx: 32768

unsloth/Ministral-3-14B-Instruct-2512-Q4_0:
  context-window: 8192
  ngpu-layers: 0
  split-mode: row
  offload-kqv: true
```

The `/YARN` suffix is a **config variant** — multiple entries can target
the same on-disk model and be selected per request by passing the full
variant name as the `model` field.

Kronk seeds this file from an embedded default on first server start;
your edits are preserved across upgrades. To point at an alternative file
for testing, use the `--model-config-file` server flag:

```shell
kronk server start --model-config-file=./my-test-config.yaml
```
